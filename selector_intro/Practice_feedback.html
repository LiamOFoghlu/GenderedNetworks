	<p>This is the second part of the practice component. Below is displayed the second round score of the fictional performer you selected. Please review the score and make your decision on what the (fictional) referrer's payoff should be.</p>
    <br>

    <h5>Selected performer's second round score</h5>
    <p>You selected {{performer_letter}}, {{performer_name}}. In the second round of the (fictional) task, {{performer_name}} scored {{practice_performer_score}}. Your payoff for selecting {{performer_name}} is: {{practice_payoff}}</p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h5>Referrer payoff</h5>
    <p>{{performer_letter}}, {{performer_name}}, was referred to you by {{referrer_name}}.</p>
    <p>Please consider {{performer_name}}'s score and decide whether you wish to:
    <ul>
        <li>Reward {{referrer_name}}, by increasing the referrer payoff to {{ Constants.referrer_reward}}</li>
        <li>Punish {{referrer_name}}, by decreasing the referrer payoff to {{ Constants.referrer_punishment}}</li>
        <li>Leave {{referrer_name}}'s payoff at {{ Constants.referrer_neither}}</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Remember, this is just a practice round. Your decision here will affect neither your own payoff nor the payoff of any actual referrer.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What payoff should referrer {{referrer_name}} get?</p>
