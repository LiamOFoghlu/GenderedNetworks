<h5>The performers</h5>
<p>On April 7 2022, about 100 "performers" were hired via Prolific to perform two separate tasks. The first task was a maths quiz. The second task was a reading comprehension test concerning childcare practices. They did two rounds of each task.</p>

<br>
<h5>The referrers</h5>
<p>On April 9 2022, about 600 “referrers” were hired via Prolific. They were shown profiles of randomly chosen performers. The profiles contained information on the score of the performers in the first round of the maths or childcare knowledge task as well as some biographical data. The referrers were asked whether they wished to “refer” the performer to a group of “selectors”. If they chose not to refer, they received a payoff of {{Constants.referrer_no_refer_bonus}}. If they chose to refer, they received a payoff of {{Constants.referrer_neither}}.</p>
<br>
<h5>Your role</h5>
<p>Your task is to take on the role of "selector".</p> 
<p>Shortly you will be shown, in sequence, randomly paired profiles of performers. Besides providing some biographical data, the performers’ profiles will display information on whether the performer is referred or not and, if referred, by whom. If a performer was not referred, this does not mean they were necessarily better or worse than the referred performers.</p>
<p>You will review four profile pairs of performers from each task. After seeing the profiles, you will be asked which performer you wish to select. Once you have reviewed all four profile pairs, you will be shown the score of each performer you selected in the second round of the task. Your payoff for each selection is tied to the performer's second round score.</p> 
<p>Your maximum payoff per selection is {{ Constants.selector_reward }}. You will get a percentage of this sum equal to the percentage of correct answers given by the performer in the second round. For example, if they answered 60% of the questions correctly, you will get 60% of {{Constants.selector_reward}}, which is {{Constants.sixty_percent}}. Over this whole activity you will make eight selection decisions and can therefore earn up to {{Constants.max_selection_reward}} for your selections.</p>
<br>
<h5>Referrer feedback</h5>
<p>Having been shown the second round score of each performer, you will be asked to choose - if you wish - to punish or reward the referrer for referring the performer you chose. You can also do nothing. Remember, the referrer made the referral decision knowing only the first round score.</p>
<p>If you do nothing, the referrer keeps their payoff of {{Constants.referrer_neither}}. If you punish the referrer, their payoff decreases to {{Constants.referrer_punishment}}. If you reward them, their payoff increases to {{Constants.referrer_reward}}. Note that the decision to reward or punish the referrer does not affect your payoff. </p>

<br>
<p>This diagram shows the sequence you will follow for each decision.</p>
