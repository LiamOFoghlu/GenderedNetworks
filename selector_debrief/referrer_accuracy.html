<P>Before you finish, please answer the following question, with the chance to earn some extra money.</P>
<p>Both female and male referrers were hired to review the performance of the performers and to decide whether or not they should be referred to selectors.</p>
<p>The referrers made their decision based on the performer's score in the first round of the relevant task.</p>
<p>Now imagine two groups: the group of all performers referred by female referrers, and the group of all performers referred by male referrers.</p>
<p>To earn some extra money, we would like to ask you: which group scored higher in the second round of each task?</p> 
<p>You will have to give two answers, one for each task.</p> 
<p>For each correct answer, you will earn â‚¬0.50.</p>
