<p>This is the {{ page_order }} task you will have to evaluate. On the next page you will see the profile of a performer who completed the {{task}} task and will be asked whether you wish to refer them. The performer had to answer five maths questions within {{ timer }} minutes. Unanswered questions were treated as wrong answers.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of the questions faced by the performers, two of the five are given below. Before you continue to the referral stage, please try to answer them. Don't worry, your payoff doesn't depend on answering right or wrong - the purpose is just to familiarise yourelf with the task.</p>
